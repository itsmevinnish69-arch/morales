            Lending a helping hand, listening to one's suggestions or queries, inspiring, leading, and serving others were once my duties as a student leader.
            In my previous school, the Silangit National High School, I were once elected as a member of the Suprem Studemnt Learner Government (SSLG). Being
            a student leader means everyday is a challenge, for a reason that you must always be in check. Time management, patience, and perseverance is
            one of the principle that I acquired as a student leader. Moreover, the most essential weaspon to resolve any challenges that comes in our organization
            is teamwork and not being bias. In this way, I have given the chance to lead, to persevere, to be a great citizen, and to be the voice of the unheard.
            <br><br>
            As I believe that, being a student leader is about making a positive impact, inspiring others, and leaving a lasting legacy. It's about listening to others,
            taking initiative, and empowering your peers to do the same. By being a positive influence and role model, you can create change, build community, and make a 
            difference in the lives of those around you.
            <br><br>
            In a saying, <b>"The First Step to Leadership is Servanthood"</b>, it will embed in our mind that we're not only born to show off, we are born to serve in
            order for us to become a great leader. So don't be afraid to take the risks and step out from your comfort zone as it is often where the greatest growth and opportunities lie.
            <br><br>
            As a student leader before, this is my advocacy, the advocacy that encourages and urges every aspiring youth to embrace their potential to become a student leader,
            the voice of the unheard and the eyes of the unseen. You can be a game-changer and make a lasting impact to your school or community. So be it, Lux Mundi lead the way!
